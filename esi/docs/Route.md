and makes sure properties required by API are set, but the set of arguments
will change when the set of required properties is changed

### NewRouteWithDefaults

`func NewRouteWithDefaults() *Route`

NewRouteWithDefaults instantiates a new Route object
This constructor will only assign default values to properties that have it defined,
but it doesn't guarantee that properties required by API are set

### GetRoute

`func (o *Route) GetRoute() []int64`

GetRoute returns the Route field if non-nil, zero value otherwise.

### GetRouteOk

`func (o *Route) GetRouteOk() (*[]int64, bool)`

GetRouteOk returns a tuple with the Route field if it's non-nil, zero value otherwise
and a boolean to check if the value has been set.
